This project analyses a dataset on sales prices in an electrical shop. It applies Python libraries(such as numpy, pandas, and matplotlib) and other modules and Python conditionals to perform some Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset.
This code answers some questions(example what time is known for best sales? Which products are purchased most and at what times? etc.) to help shopowner make informed decisions.
